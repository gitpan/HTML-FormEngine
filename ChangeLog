0.7
---
	
Till version 0.6.1 gaff was an php tool. When i started programming perl
and recognized that it is much more powerfull than php, i ported gaff to
perl. I completly rewrote it and thereby added many new features:

	- flexible template engine for writing skins
	- check routines with translatable error messages (using gettext)
	- a more modular design, so that gaff can easily be extended and
	enhanced
	- a more detailed documentation

packaging the 0.7.3 release. CPAN doesn't like this.

0.7.4
-----
	- fixed bug in _handle_error
	- template parsing is now done from left to right and from top to
	bottom, independend of wether a variable, a handler call, a loop
	etc. is found

	- template variables are now valid for all subtemplates too!
	- enhanced documentation

	- because of that the following methods are not in FormEngine anymore:
	    - set_skin

	    - set_default
	    - add_default
	    - set_handler

	    - set_confirm_skin
	    - add_confirm_skin
	    - set_confirm_handler
	    - add_confirm_handler
