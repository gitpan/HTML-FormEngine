0.7
---
	
Till version 0.6.1 gaff was an php tool. When i started programming perl
and recognized that it is much more powerfull than php, i ported gaff to
perl. I completly rewrote it and thereby added many new features:

	- flexible template engine for writing skins
	- check routines with translatable error messages (using gettext)
	- a more modular design, so that gaff can easily be extended and
	enhanced
	- a more detailed documentation

packaging the 0.7.3 release. CPAN doesn't like this.
