- password shouldn't be displayed when confirming

- submit_name method?? should submit the form name (FormEngine) also when submit-button is not pressed

- Data Text-Dumping (hidden fields not listed)

- besides confirm skin there should also be a text skin for the data text dumping

- Email-Feature? using data text dumping?

- use carp more consequent

- make FormEngine input none-html

- another possibilty for check for confirm and text: [ ] option [ ]  other [x] select [ ] etc.

- distinguish between the 2 possibilites to use the "sub" key. best would be to invent another key.

- OPTION vs. SUBTITLE. Think! (we've to use OPTION atm because of the default-settings)

- rethink mark of not_null fields. doesn't work for e.g. TITLE and ERROR_IN etc.

- commented '$default{_column}->{TD_SUBTITLE_VALIGN} = 'top';' out in SkinComplex.pm. Which influence does that have?
