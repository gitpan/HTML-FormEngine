FormEngine version 1.01
==========================

FormEngine is a extensible perl module for managing html/xhtml forms. You
can create, validate and control forms with FormEngine. The api is designed
to make the job easy when only simple forms are needed, but it also supports 
very complex tasks. You don't need any knowledge about html,
but if you have, you can suit the form design easily.
FormEngine is known to work with CGI.pm and mod_perl, all it needs is a
reference to a hash with the GET or POST data.
Please see the POD for additional information.

NOTE: Due to a consequent redesign FormEngine 1.0 is not compatible to
older versions. Please read MIGRATING for help on migrating your old
scripts to FormEngine 1.0.  FormEngine::DBSQL < 1.0 will also not work
with this version of FormEngine, you have to install FormEngine::DBSQL
>= 1.0.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, type:

to your systems locale directory. If this isn't /usr/share/locale,
don't forget to adapt the path through the skins constructor!
